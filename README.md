# distanceFunctions

This repository stores two distance functions based on the Euclidean algortihm and the Dijkstra algorithm. This R package was created as part of a University Course project.

## Getting started

When loaded into your R session, the functions can be accessed through euclidean() and dijkstra(). For more information about each function, check ?euclidean and ?dijkstra.
