Description: The functions provided by this package are implementations of two famous algorithms. The Euclidean algorithm will find the greatest common divisor of two integers by performing division-with-remainder. The Dijkstra algorithm takes a graph and a starting node, and will find the shortest distance to every other node in the graph.
